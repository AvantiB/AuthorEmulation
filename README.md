# Emulating Author Style: A Feasibility Study of Prompt-enabled Text Stylization with Off-the-Shelf LLMs
**[Published in the Personalization of Generative AI (PERSONALIZE) workshop (EACL2024) (https://aclanthology.org/2024.personalize-1.6/)]**

User-centric personalization of text opens many avenues of applications from stylized email composition to machine translation. Existing approaches in this domain often encounter limitations in data and resource requirements. Drawing inspiration from the success of prompt-enabled stylization in related fields, this work conducts the first feasibility study into 12 pre-trained SOTA LLMs for author style emulation. Although promising, the results suggest that current off-the-shelf LLMs fall short of achieving effective author style emulation.
